                        One of the most basic vehicles that countries use in modern warfare are tanks.
                        This heavily armed and very dangerous machine had its beginnings during the First World War.

                    The E 100 was conceived as the basis for a self-propelled gun, an antiaircraft vehicle, 
                    and a tank destroyer. This tank features a massive 170mm cannon that bears
                     striking resemblance to the artillery gun on the GwTiger and GwTiger(P).
                      Dealing an average of 1050 damage a shot, the JagdPanzer E-100 can strike fear 
                      into the hearts of even the bravest tankers in World of Tanks. The alpha of the gun has
                     the ability to bring down even tier X tanks with two shots. 
                    However, development was never started.(source: wiki.wargaming.net).

                    The FV4005 Stage II has essentially negligible armour,
                     due to the gigantic turret providing only 14 mm of protection from any given angle.
                      Due to this and the vehicle's crew being largely based in the turret, the FV4005
                       is extremely vulnerable to even .50 calibre machine guns, and any large 
                       calibre explosives can and will inflict overpressure damage on them, which is always fatal.
                    The only redeeming trait in regards to survivability is that 
                    the crew may survive some side-on attacks due to the sheer size of the gun breech.  (source: wiki.wargaming.net).

                    The development of a heavy tank destroyer on the basis of the IS-7 
                    heavy tank was started in 1950. Three design projects were developed,
                     one of which resulted in a full-size wooden prototype.
                     However, further development was discontinued due to phasing out mass-production of the IS-7.
                     Hugging tall tanks, like the Maus, is also a dangerous idea,
                      as they can easily overmatch your weak hull roof and out trade you easily.
                       If the enemy is using premium ammunition, 
                     then it's better to take cover as the enemy can penetrate your front most of the time. (source: wiki.wargaming.net)

                    The development of an advanced tank for Swedish army was performed by Sven Berge.
                     First drafts of the unique vehicle were developed in 1956. 
                     By 1961, the design of the new vehicle was finalized, and a wooden prototype was built.
                      Later, the first Strv S1 prototype was built and used for testing of the new
                       type of suspension, which allowed for vertical aiming of the rigidly mounted gun.
                        The Strv S2 prototype was developed by the end of 1962. 
                    Both prototypes became the basis for
                     the mass production of the Strv 103 tank. (source: wiki.wargaming.net)
