                    The Manticore is a British tier 10 light tank.
                    A light tank project with an oscillating turret for providing anti-tank 
                    defense behind infantry positions. No prototypes were built, 
                    and it existed only in blueprints.
                    The Manticore marks the end of its British light line.(source: wiki.wargaming.net).

                    variant of the M41 light tank with an enlarged turret and 90-mm gun.
                     Trials started on May 5, 1954. The trials were a success,
                      but the tank never saw mass production due to lack of interest from the military authorities. 
                    Imagine the KV-2 with small size and agile speed; 
                    this is the result of insane combination of the deadly "derp gun" and mobility.
                     When stock, the T49 is just a Bulldog with higher hit points, lower speed and camo ratings.
                      But when it receives the deadly 152mm gun, the T49 becomes one of the most dangerous
                       enemies you'll face in Tier 9 - 10 ranks,
                     especially if you play lightly armored tanks (such as in the French line). (source: wiki.wargaming.net).

                    The Panhard E.B.R. (Panhard Engin Blind√© de Reconnaissance, French: 
                    Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle) is an armoured car designed by Panhard
                     for the French Army and later used across the globe, notably by the French 
                     Army during the Algerian War and the Portuguese Army during the Portuguese
                      Colonial War in Angola, 
                    Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau.
                    The E.B.R. is an 8x8 wheeled reconnaissance vehicle based on the previous 
                    Panhard AM 40 P/Model 201, a light armored car born before the Second World War, 
                    but remained only at prototype level. (source: wiki.wargaming.net)

                  <p class="card-text">
                    On June 8, 1957, Rheinmetall recorded a patent for a new 
                    light tank with an oscillating turret and a gun with trunnions. 
                    The proposed design allowed engineers to equip light vehicles with 
                    powerful 90-mm and 105-mm guns while preserving the minimum vehicle height.
                     Rheinmetall did not have their own chassis for the subsequent tank production, 
                     and they offered their turret to other plants. The vehicle is a project on the basis 
                     of the Hanomag and Henschel chassis. Existed only in blueprints. (source: wiki.wargaming.net)
