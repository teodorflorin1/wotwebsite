                        One of the most basic vehicles that countries use in modern warfare are tanks.
                        This heavily armed and very dangerous machine had its beginnings during the First World War.

                    The IS-7 heavy tank, also known by its project name Object 260, is a Soviet tank that began development in 1945. 
                    The vehicle existed only in prototype form and was cancelled in favor of the T-10 tank.
                    The armour was engineered in a similar fashion to the IS-3, 
                    with a pike nose on the upper glacis sporting 150mm of armor sloped at 65Â°.
                    The 130 mm S-70 was a conversion of a naval gun, firing a ~33 kilograms
                     (73 lb) armor piercing round ~900 metres per second (3,000 ft/s) (source: wikipedia).

                    The Panzerkampfwagen E-100, was a German super-heavy tank design developed 
                    towards the end of World War II. According to the blueprints, the tank would be armed with 
                    a both a 150 mm gun and a 75 mm gun. Being a super-veay, E100 fully combat loaded,
                    weights over 120 tones. (source: wikipedia).

                  <p class="card-text">
                    The Type 5, also known as the Type 2605, was one of the variants of the O-I superheavy tank,
                     developed during WWII. The vehicle was planned to be used for 
                    breaking through fortified enemy lines and for coastal defense.
                    Sometimes known as "Godzilla" or just Type 5, the Type 5 Heavy holds the title as one of the most frequently
                     changed Tier X vehicles in the game.Not much is known about the Type 5.
                      It presumably had the same armament as the Type 4, believed to be a 14 cm naval gun. 
                      Just like it, many details like armor, speed, engine type and so on are unknown. 
                      Even if the Type 5 existed as a project, it presumably remained on papers due to 
                      Japan losing the war. (source: wiki.wargaming.net)

                    The AMX 50 (official designation) or AMX-50 B was a French heavy tank designed in the
                     immediate post Second World War period. It was proposed as, in succession, the French medium,
                      heavy, and main battle tank, incorporating many advanced features. 
                      It was cancelled in the late 1950s however,
                     due to unfavourable economic and political circumstances
                      after serious delays in development.
                      The type was armed with a 120 mm gun, also with a 1,000 m/s muzzle velocity,
                       in response to the perceived threat posed by 
                      the Soviet heavy tanks, such as the IS-3 and the T-10. (source: wiki.wargaming.net)
