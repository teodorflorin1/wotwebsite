                        One of the most basic vehicles that countries use in modern warfare are tanks.
                        This heavily armed and very dangerous machine had its beginnings during the First World War.

                    The vehicle was developed by the Design Bureau of the Army Engineering
                    Committee under the supervision of A. F. Kravtsev from March through August 1949.
                     The tank was supposed to position a driver in the fighting compartment, as well as
                      feature a 100 mm gun with an automatic loading system, and coaxial large-caliber 
                      machinegun. The plan was to mount the 12-cylinder opposed-piston turbo-diesel engine. The mounting brackets with ski-shaped supports were used as support rollers. Development of the project was discontinued at the blueprints stage in December 1949.
                    The K-91 marks the end of its Soviet medium line (source: wikipedia).

                    The Leopard (or Leopard 1) is a main battle tank designed and produced by Porsche 
                    in West Germany that first entered service in 1965. Developed in an era when HEAT 
                    warheads were thought to make conventional heavy armour of limited value, the Leopard 
                    focused on firepower in the form of the German-built version of the British L7 105-mm gun,
                     and improved cross-country performance
                     that was unmatched by other designs of the era. (source: wikipedia).

                    The M48 Patton is an American first-generation main battle tank (MBT)
                     introduced in February 1952, being designated as the 90mm Gun Tank: M48. 
                     It was designed as a replacement for the M26 Pershing, M4 Sherman variants 
                     and M46 Pattons used in the Korean War, and as the successor to the M47 Patton.
                      Nearly 12,000 M48s were built, mainly by Chrysler and American Locomotive Company,
                       from 1952 to 1961. The M48 underwent many design modifications and improvements
                        during its production life. This led to a wide variety of suspension systems,
                         cupola styles, power packs,
                     fenders and other details among individual tanks. (source: wiki.wargaming.net)

                    Conceptualization of a draft design developed at the request of General
                     Francesco Rossi who believed that only light vehicles weighing up to 35 
                     tons would be effective in a new war. Such an innovative design was not approved;
                     development was discontinued when Italy joined the Standard Tank project.
                     Needless to say, this makes the Progretto way less situational than autoloaders,
                      while also introducing opportunistic gameplay into the mix. This 
                      requires little effort to get used to - as long as you are able to wait for
                      a loaded gun it's a perfectly viable single-shooter. (source: wiki.wargaming.net)
